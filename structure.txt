In the /art directory, things in folders are part of collections. 
They will be placed together when the collections page is built.

Anything not in a folder does not have a collection and will only show on the "all" page

Things in the art/homepage folder are the key pieces of art that will be shown on the homepage
These should be the pieces of art you are most proud of as they will be seen by anyone
who visits the site. These WILL NEED TO BE DUPLICATES of the thing elsewhere for simplicty.

The things in templates/ are txt representations of the HTML that will be loaded by the
python build script and filled in with the things in the folders.
